## Details
### Lab 1 - CentOS Installation
Installed RAM, HDD, keyboard and mouse to a given server machine and installed the CentOS 7 Linux Distribution.

### Lab 2 - Ethernet Cables and Network Configuration
Used a given Cat 5 cable to create a T-568A standard ethernet cable terminated by an RJ45 jack. Configured the Linux server's
network settings to connect to a network switch.

### Lab 3 - LAMP Stack Installation
Installed the Apache server, PHP server-side scripting language, and MySQL RDBMS to complete a LAMP stack on the Linux server.

### Lab 4 - phpMyAdmin, NTP, HTTPS, and self-signed SSL Certificate
Installed phpMyAdmin GUI for MySQL, Network Time Protocol to synchronize time through the Internet, 
and installed SSL to self-sign a certificate for the server.

### Lab 5 - DNS and Let's Encrypt
Installed and configured a DNS server for the Linux machine and used it to obtain a domain name (provided by the instructor). 
Cloned LetsEncrypt Client (Certbot) to obtain a valid certificate for the server from the Let's Encrypt CA.
